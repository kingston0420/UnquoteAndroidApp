# UnquoteAndroidApp
This is a phone app built using Java and Android Studio
In Unquote, players must correct Internet misinformationâ€”in our case, the kind that comes in the form of picture-quotes.
A random quote is displayed on the screen, and the player have to choose the right person that the quote comes from.
A sample video of how the app works is here: [Unquote](https://youtu.be/MCnJg8QAIdw)
